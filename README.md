# init314
Configures your Raspberry Pi

## Introduction
<b>init314</b> is a powerful script that quickly configures your Raspberry Pi and makes it more secure, stable and usable. I was writing this script during my first year of Master's study at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana. I was also using <b>init314</b> during the final assignment at the course Image based biometry.

I believe that since Raspberry Pi 3B(+) and 4B have launched, these small computers can now serve as a replacement for a full desktop computer. Default Raspbian desktop installation is good enough for education purposes and programming, but has some security issues and some software configurations, which may not be appropriate for an average desktop user. <b>init314</b> attempts to fix these issues by creating separated user accounts, configuring audio and video, installing aditional packages and also does many other things related to security, stability and user experience... 

<b>init314</b> is appropriate for users who want to use Raspberry Pi for daily browsing the internet, listening to music, watching movies and playing some video games. It tailors the Raspberry Pi to suit your needs.

## Running a script
I recommend to run <b>init314</b> after the default installation of Raspbian with desktop. Root is required to run this script.
